WHATCH'EM requires two Perl modules to be installed (POSIX and Statistics::Descriptive).
Can't install them directly because I don't have admin permissions, so need to install them locally in my home directory instead.

  Step 1: Install local::lib in home directory.
    https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique

    See steps in url above.

  Step 2: Install modules.
    https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#SYNOPSIS

    perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(POSIX)'
    perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(Statistics::Descriptive)'


Edited run_container.pl.
  - changed $path

Added new environmental variable CSM_SCRIPTS. This is used by all the WHATCH'EM ncl plotting files to find certain plotting scripts.
CSM_SCRIPTS="/home/local/WIN/cyasana1/miniconda3/envs/ncl_stable/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm"; export CSM_SCRIPTS;

Downloaded Visual Studio Code extensions for previewing .ps images (the output of the WHATCH'EM ncl plotting scripts).
 - PostScript Language v1.0.1 (mxschmitt)
    - needed for the other extension to work
 - PostScript Preview v0.4.2 (Ahnaf An Nafee)
    - adds preview image button to .ps file (next to split window button)

NOTE:
For some reason run_container.pl can't find the locally installed packages (POSIX and Statistics::Descriptive in local::lib) 
unless I rerun the .bashrc file every single time I open a new terminal.
So, to get run_container.pl to run properly, I need to first run the following code...
    > . ~/.bashrc                (so that the packages will be found)
    > conda activate ncl_stable  (so that the ncl plotting will work)
... and then do
    > perl run_container.pl
